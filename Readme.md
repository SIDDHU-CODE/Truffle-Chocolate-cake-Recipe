It is important to cool the warm chocolate mixture before adding the remaining dry ingredients and egg. Adding egg to a hot mixture can cook it before it has been mixed through - the result is a cake containing scrambled egg. It is best to use a bamboo skewer to check if a cake is ready - the mixture will easily stick to the bamboo if the cake is not yet cooked, or slip off if ready. A metal skewer can be too slippery for raw cake mix to stick to, so you won't be able to tell if the cake is cooked through. This cake is best left in its pan to cool before turning on to a rack. Densely textured cakes, such as this, are more delicate when hot and can easily split if turned out too early. Make sure the cake is completely cooled before splitting. Use a ruler to mark an even line at regular points around the middle of the cake, then use toothpicks or kitchen string to mark this line. Use a large, serrated knife to split in half, using the toothpicks or string as a guide.
